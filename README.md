# Who We Are?
We are a community of women who share design goals and want to contribute in a healthy and constructive manner to the design community. 
We are stronger together as a community than alone so we focus on creating a safe space for collaboration, networking and mentorship. We are creating an environment that helps to not only increase the number of female designers but also help to transform them into working professionals. We are building a platform to collaborate and connect with other women designers.

# What we do
- Community, Connection and Collaboration: We want to create a community of women who collaborate, challenge, inspire, and encourage one another to build professional careers.
- Bridge the gaps left behind in bootcamp by providing physical presence to help review and discuss with these designers.
- We are looking to organize workshops, masterclasses, and design challenges to keep people engaged and achieve our goal of challenging one another to become not only better designers, but better professionals.
